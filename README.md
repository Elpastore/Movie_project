Project Idea: Movie Recommendation System
Build a movie recommendation system using Python that utilizes sets and dictionaries. 
This project will involve the following components:

1.Data Collection: You'll need a dataset of movies, including attributes like title, genre, release year, and user ratings. 
You can use public datasets or web scraping to gather this data.
database = {
    "movie1": {"genre": ["action", "thriller"], "rating": [8, 9]},
    "movie2": {"genre": ["comedy", "drama"], "rating": [7, 6]},
    "movie3": {"genre": ["comedy", "drama"], "rating": [7, 6]},
}
This mean that we are going to create a nested dictionnary
2.Data Preprocessing: Clean and organize the data, removing duplicates and irrelevant information. 
Create dictionaries to store information about each movie, such as its title, genre, and user ratings.

3.User Input: Implement a system where users can input their preferences, such as favorite genres or preferred release years.
 Store this user data in sets or dictionaries.
In this step we are going to store users preferenences
Recommendation Algorithm: Develop an algorithm that takes user preferences into account and uses sets and dictionaries to find movies
 that match the user's criteria. You can use set operations to find common elements between the user's preferences and the movie attributes.
4. Add user account and get the list of movie:
    In this part we can try to manage list of movie
    We can build a program like a to_do_list that give information about movie's status watching and no watching(delete those with status watched)==> (Abas)
    So each user will have his own list and saved data.===>John

Recommendation Output: Present a list of recommended movies to the user based on their input.
 You can rank the recommendations using various factors, such as user ratings or relevance to user preferences.

User Interaction: Implement a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the system, input their preferences,
 and receive movie recommendations.

This project will not only help you practice data structures in Python but also involve working with real data, 
creating user-friendly interfaces, and developing a recommendation algorithm. 
It's a comprehensive project that covers various aspects of programming and data manipulation. Good luck with your project!
